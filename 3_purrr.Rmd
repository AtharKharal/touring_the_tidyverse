# purrr

is a "...complete and consistent functional programming toolkit for R". It draws inspiration from multiple languages (Haskell, Scala, Javascript, `rlist` package). From vignette:

> However, the goal of purrr is not to try and simulate a purer functional programming language in R; we donâ€™t want to implement a second-class version of Haskell in R. The goal is to give you similar expressiveness to an FP language, while allowing you to write code that looks and works like R.

# Why purrr

1. API responses (JSON, XML or any list-like alternatives).
2. Make lists less `r emo::ji("ghost")`.
3. Abstraction over `for` loops.
4. Putting all `*apply` functions from base R into more principled framework.

# purrr

Covering today:

1. Working with iteration in principled and safe manner.
2. Predicates collection.
3. Working with lists + crossing.
4. Working with mappers/functions.
5. Functional programming.

# Overview of the API


```{r purrr_api, echo = FALSE}
length(getNamespaceExports("purrr"))
```
