# purrr

is a "...complete and consistent functional programming toolkit for R". It draws inspiration from multiple languages (Haskell, Scala, Javascript, `rlist` package). From vignette:

> However, the goal of purrr is not to try and simulate a purer functional programming language in R; we donâ€™t want to implement a second-class version of Haskell in R. The goal is to give you similar expressiveness to an FP language, while allowing you to write code that looks and works like R.

# Why purrr

1. API responses (JSON, XML or any list-like alternatives).
2. Make lists less `r emo::ji("ghost")`.
3. Efficient abstraction over `for` loops.
4. Putting all `*apply` functions from base R into more principled framework.
5. Gateway drug to functional programming and all the goodies to go along with it (e.g., parallel programming).
6. Split-Apply-Combine paradigm.
7. List-columns.
8. Plays nicely with pipe.
